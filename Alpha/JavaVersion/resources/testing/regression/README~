This directory contains tests meant to exercise code integrity, not performance.
So these files are really just a bunch of resources for doing so: simulated input
sequences, scripts, etc.


This is a far from complete test suite, its just meant to cover the end-to-end
functionality for code coverage. The idea in these tests is to exercise all possible
states that can be generated by the user when using the interface.

Test cases (add to these!):
Precondition: FastMode built with keyMap.txt, and thus all of the values it generates (for ui bounds, etc)
  1) A valid word: MISSISSIPPI
    File: validWord.txt
  2) An input sequence of length 1: only one in-bounds coordinate (be aware the obvious dependency on the ui coordinates, if these change)
    File: lengthOneValid.txt
  3) An input sequence of length 4. Signal Processor requires at least four data points to operate on, so this should pass.
  3) An input sequence of length 1: only one out-of-bounds coordinate (same as previous test: be aware the ui bound dependency)
    File: lengthOneInvalid.txt
  4) An input sequence of length 0: no coordinates
    File: lengthZero.txt
  5) A very long input sequence: MISSISSIPPI input sequence catted to itself a few times.
    File: longInput.txt
  6) An input sequence with a normal number of inputs, but all of which are out of bounds.
    File: allInvalid.txt
Test passage standards: no errors, exceptions, explosions

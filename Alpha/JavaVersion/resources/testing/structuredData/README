This directory contains sample coordinate input streams for multiple words. Each file represents
the raw input stream for a given word, and the current ones were generated directly from the 
EyeTribe hardware. I believe it was running at 30Hz, with smoothing, but I may be wrong.

This folder is specifically structured according to the requirements of StructuredDataset, which
requires a keymap.txt. Each training file consists of the target word on the first line, followed
by the stream of sensor inputs representing that word on subsequent lines.

Note that in code you can also test performance by adding random error to the cooredinates in these
files, as far as testing error tolerance

The actual input sequence here is for the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog in Biloxi Mississippi".

The testTruncVocab.txt file contains output generated from a moderately-to-poorly performing classifier,
such that these are the subset of words most like the text inputs in regression/ for "the brown fox jumped..."
test sequence.

Using this subset of vocabulary helps test methods faster, compared with testing the entire 60k word vocab.

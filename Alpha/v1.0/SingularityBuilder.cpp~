  It will take a lot of test data to figure out what event parameters are even useful, such that we can
  optimize the precision of this function and build a really good state machine for the event triggers.

  For instance, for some test input path zigzag (as a list of xy coordinates in some file), leverage everything:
  build another file of theta, dtheta, velocity, angular acceleration, etc, per that path. Analyze the xy coordinates
  for every possible attribute you might think of, and print these to some other file. Then analyze which of those
  attributes is merely noise, and which corresponds to data that might be useful to event detection.

  You might think of every point in time (each mouse reading, each tick) as a vector, and the current system
  state as a set of k-vectors. Each vector contains a bunch of attributes. A cluster is identified when the
  system (the matrix) suddenly changes in some meaningful way. The matrix analogy is intentional, since it comes from
  control theory, so existing solution undoubtedly exist for this simple problem of geometric key-point detection.

  And use python for these experiments, to avoid the labor overhead of c++.

  Otherwise the highlevel behavior/state machine of this function is simple:
     -detect event
     -capture event
     -process event (clustering)
     -pass event
     -goto top

  Notes: This likely suffers what I call the "elbow" problem. Most "clusters" occur at a sharp angle.
  This means that the mean value of that cluster (including both edges of the angle) will be inside
  the angle, instead of very near the point. But we're after the point. We could fix this error later,
  if its even a problem--it mainly depends on the resolution (in Hz) of the sensor. Its also an argument
  for more geometrically-based point analysis, as opposed to this, which is essentially cluster oriented.
